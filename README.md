Dynasty is a powerful inheritance system for Rust, designed specifically for game engines and complex application architectures. It provides a natural class-based inheritance model while maintaining Rust's safety guarantees and performance characteristics.

## Features ✨

- **Safe Inheritance**: Implement class hierarchies with compile-time safety guarantees
- **Runtime Type Information**: Robust RTTI system for type checking and reflection
- **Smart Downcasting**: Safe and ergonomic downcasting between types in the hierarchy
- **Reflection API**: Optional reflection system for runtime introspection
- **Serialization Support**: Optional integration with serde for serialization
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Most features compile away to zero overhead
- **Game Engine Ready**: Designed for high-performance game development scenarios

## Quick Start 🚀

Add Dynasty to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
dynasty = "0.1.0"
```

Create your class hierarchy:

```rust
use dynasty::prelude::*;

// Define a base class
#[derive(Class, Debug)]
pub struct Entity {
    id: u64,
    name: String,
}

// Create a derived class
#[inherit(Entity)]
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Character {
    base: Entity,
    health: f32,
    level: u32,
}

// Multiple levels of inheritance
#[inherit(Character)]
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Player {
    base: Character,
    experience: u32,
}

fn main() {
    // Create instances
    let player = Player {
        base: Character {
            base: Entity {
                id: 1,
                name: "Hero".to_string(),
            },
            health: 100.0,
            level: 1,
        },
        experience: 0,
    };

    // Use safe downcasting
    let as_character: &Character = player.as_parent();
    println!("Character level: {}", as_character.level);
}
```

## Advanced Features 🛠️

### Reflection

Enable the reflection feature to access runtime type information:

```toml
[dependencies]
dynasty = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["reflection"] }
```

```rust
use dynasty::prelude::*;

#[derive(Class)]
struct Transform {
    position: (f32, f32, f32),
}

// Implement reflection
impl Reflect for Transform {
    fn get_field(&self, name: &str) -> Option<&dyn Any> {
        match name {
            "position" => Some(&self.position),
            _ => None,
        }
    }
    
    // TODO: implement other reflection methods
}
```

### Serialization

Enable serialization support:

```toml
[dependencies]
dynasty = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["serialization"] }
```

```rust
use dynasty::prelude::*;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Class, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct GameObject {
    id: u64,
    components: Vec<Box<dyn Component>>,
}
```

## Project Structure 📁

Dynasty is organized as a workspace with two main crates:

- `dynasty`: The core runtime library providing the inheritance system
- `dynasty-macros`: Procedural macros for the derive and attribute implementations

## Performance 🚄

Dynasty is designed with performance in mind:

- Zero-cost abstractions for most features
- Compile-time resolution of inheritance relationships
- Minimal runtime overhead for type checking
- Efficient virtual dispatch using Rust's trait system

## Examples 📚

Check out these examples to see Dynasty in action:

### Component System

```rust
use dynasty::prelude::*;

#[derive(Class)]
struct Component {
    enabled: bool,
}

#[inherit(Component)]
struct RigidBody {
    base: Component,
    mass: f32,
    velocity: (f32, f32, f32),
}

#[inherit(Component)]
struct MeshRenderer {
    base: Component,
    mesh: String,
    material: String,
}
```

### Event System

```rust
use dynasty::prelude::*;

#[derive(Class)]
struct Event {
    timestamp: f64,
}

#[inherit(Event)]
struct CollisionEvent {
    base: Event,
    entity_a: u64,
    entity_b: u64,
    point: (f32, f32, f32),
}
```
